- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @davpea (David Pearson), I'm based in the UK, I work at Red Hat as a Solution Architect.
- ðŸ‘€ I'm especially focused on open source, developer portals, systems programming and API's.. most of my content on GitHub relates to my continuous learning, tinkering with code, generally being a hobbyist / geek (or should that be technologist).
- ðŸŒ± Outside work, I love working with Apple XCode and learning how to improve my skills with the Swift language, and anything related to the Swift package Index and Vapor (Server Side Swift).
- ðŸ“« You can reach my via X/twitter (https://twitter.com/davpears) or LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/davpea/)
