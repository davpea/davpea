- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @davpea (David Pearson), I'm based in the UK, I work at Red Hat as a Solution Architect.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in technology in general and especially open source, systems programming and API's.. most of my content on GitHub relates to my continuous learning, tinkering with code, generally being a geek (or should that be technologist).
- ðŸŒ± Outside work, I love working with Apple XCode and learning how to build apps with SwiffUI and the Swift language, inclusing server side Swift (Vapor & Kitura), also Python and Golang.
